## FlixTV-Clone---Netflix-Style-Streaming-App-in-PHP-OOP

### Description

FlixTV Clone is a simple Netflix-style streaming platform built with PHP and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

It focuses on client-side interaction and API integration, without implementing authentication or a backend system.
